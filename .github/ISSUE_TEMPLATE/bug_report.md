<!--Instructions

If you are asking a question or wish to discuss something,
or if you cannot meet the bare minimum requirements below,
please use the "discussions" area before creating an issue.

We will only be able to handle issues if you provide us with enough information.
This is on you, not us. At a BARE MINIMUM, we need:

- The version of the NuGet package you are using
- Full text or a screen shot of any error messages produced, including any stack trace.
- A clear and concise description of what the bug is, including detailed diagnostic data (log files) where possible
- Steps to reproduce the problem, or even better, a link to a minimal solution that demonstrates the problem that we can download and build. If we can't reproduce, we most likely can't fix.

The library produces semantic logging data using `TA.Utils.Logging`.
Consider injecting a logger via the constructor of `ChannelFactory` and capturing the log output to disk.
If you don't already have a suitable logger implementation, you can use the one in https://www.nuget.org/packages/TA.Utils.Logging.Nlog/
